DM3 Contacs Importer
=======================

A (yet) one-time importer for semi-structured contact information realized as a deepamehta3-plugin for v0.5-SNAPSHOT. Currently a TAB-separated .CSV-File can be partially mapped onto the dm3.contacts.*-module after being located at   ''/src/main/resources/community-tab.csv'' and build with the plugin from source.

Tested with a Mozilla Thunderbird 3.x TAB-separated .csv-file.

DeepaMehta 3 is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.
